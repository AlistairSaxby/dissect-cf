For other details, source code and up-to-date information about the simulator, please visit its [main github page](https://github.com/kecskemeti/dissect-cf).\r\n\r\n## The API documentation\r\n\r\n- Javadoc APIs for the most recent release\r\n- API Archive\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nApart from the documentation listed here, one can find plenty of useful information about the way the simulator is intended to work:\r\n- First of all, more elaborate examples can be found in the [dissect-cf-examples project](https://github.com/kecskemeti/dissect-cf-examples).\r\n- Also, the [wiki](https://github.com/kecskemeti/dissect-cf/wiki) provides further insights to advanced topics (like creating custom schedulers) and offers a [FAQ](https://github.com/kecskemeti/dissect-cf/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions). Apart from contributing with code, feel free to contribute there with documentation as well.\r\n- Do you still have some questions? If so, then please share them with the simulator's user and developer community at our [Q&A forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dissect-cf-discuss) - a registration is needed to send your questions in.\r\n","google":"UA-64484627-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
